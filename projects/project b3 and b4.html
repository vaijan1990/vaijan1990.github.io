      <h3>Skiss :</h3>
      <p>It was an overhelming experience working with group and sharing the knowledge. First we worked in collecting ideas “skiss”. Everyone started sharing their own idea in the word document.</p>
        <a href = "https://docs.google.com/a/elmerup.se/document/d/1gJtMbgf8O2nSnEukQycr2wYJ4kKRbUrno5YwZ0pa7eQ/edit?usp=sharing" id = "Skiss">Link to Skiss </a>
      <p>.. and finally we came up with the idea of “PONO mobile web” </p>

        </li>
      </ol>
      Once the idea was finalized we started to design LOGO type

      <h3>Logo type design :</h3>
      <p>
        Each of the team member came up with their own idea of logo design.</p>
        <a href="https://fr15.slack.com/messages/logos/files/F0E5S35QE/">Link to various logos in Slack page</a>
        <p>After sharing everone’s logotype we as a team finalized my logo type. I designed the logo type using a online logo designer and modified it using “Adobe photoshop”. There were some changes done to the logo type I presented which we decided as a team.</p>

      <h3>Design of Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        The next was designing the mockups. We used “trello” to discuss and design the flow. Each one designed their own mockup.  We finalized miki’s mock up and maily’s content as it was very well structured and clear.
        Once the mock up was finalized we have planned the Group activity splitting. Each one of us took responsibility for a module.

      <h3>Coding</h3>
      <h4>Version control /Github : </h4>
      <p>
        The group repository was created in github. I was able to learn and train pull requests, push requests, merge,clone in github. Everyone did their module coding and pushed in to github. Each one of us updated the CSS for their module as well.

      </p>
      <h4>Task manager / Communication : </h4>
      <p>
        We mainly used Trello and Slack group for carrying out communication and status update.
      </p>
      <h4>Without Ramverk : </h4>
      <p>
      Discussion of various  like frameworks  Normalization css and bootstrap css was done. Finally majority of us wanted to go for bootstrap to explore more on it. Hence we developed using bootstrap framework.
      </p>
      <h4>My coding part :  </h4>
      <p>
        I worked in the contact page where we have contact content on the left and google map on the right. The challenge was getting responsiveness which took me some time to do.
      </p>
      <h3>Challenges Faced / Learning :</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Using github was a challenge . Got help from team for learning pull and push request</li>
        <li>Challenge was while writing CSS where we might need to reuse classes created to avoid repetation</li>
        <li>Responsive page creation was also a challenge as we wanted to write reusable code</li>
        <li>Had a good hand on experience with bootstrap framework as well</li>
      </ul>
