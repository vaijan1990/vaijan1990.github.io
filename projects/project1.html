      One of the greatest invention which man kind has today is Internet which is creating revolutinary changes in todays world. From communications, medical fields, navy, airways, Education and where not Internet is not present. I am not able to notice the
      fact that internet is become more organized, with weighted hyperlinks, wikis, and powerful search engines. Now it is time to think of the future where this trasnformation is going to lead us.

      <ul>
        <li>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a world where up to 50 billion things (or devices) will be connected to the Internet by 2020; or, the equivalent of 6 devices for every person on the planet.
        </li>
        <li>According to a research, the average global data transmission speed in late 2009 was 1.7 megabits per second. Compare that to the record for data transmission speed set by Bell Labs: 100 petabits per second. That's equivalent to 100 billion megabits
          per second. At that speed, you could transmit 400 DVDs worth of data every second
        </li>
      </ul>

      On the other side we keep giving the Internet more and more data every day and we use more and more every year. Sharing, commenting, liking, buying, selling, writing, tweeting, hash-tagging. We are becoming more 'INTERNETTY' these days. Why not we might
      land up in getting "VIRTUAL DREAMS" in 2050!!!&#9786;&#9786;
