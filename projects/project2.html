        <h3>Yrkesrollen </h3>
       <pre>
    <b>Introduction :</b>
      
I chose to interview Front-end Developer, Chandra Kanth who has been working as a front-end developer for past 12 years with various companies and has had experience with wide range of projects in Insurance and Retail domains like Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, State Farm mutual Insurance, Walmart, IKEA to name some. Currently he is working with Folksam(one of the largest Insurance company in Sweden) as a consultant for the past 1 year. 

<b>Who is a front-end developer?</b>

We started our conversation with a cup of coffee and my question on who is a front-end developer. I was amazed by his explanation which is as follows : “Front end development, also known as client side development who works with core technical concepts in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or web application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. Our goal is to achieve Accessibility, Usability and Performance at the same time. Often we deal with more challenges as we have a great responsibility to satisfy all the type of users which might generally vary. Users might be from different background because of age, education level, physical disabilities, location factor or exposure.” Some of the other challenges faced by them is that they need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which needs careful planning on the site of the developer.

<b>About Folksam:</b>

After discussing the role of a front-end developer we slowly moved on to the next discussion where we discusses about the company and what they are exactly dealing with. 
Folksam Insurance:  Folksam is one of the large insurance companies in Sweden. The company headquarters are located in Stockholm. Folksam consists of the two mutual insurance companiesFolksam sak and Folksam liv.

<b>What is the objective of project you are working on now?</b>

The objective if the company is that they are now focusing on making their site Responsive, modernize it’s features and achieve accessiblity(for persons with disabilities). They recently started using single page application like angular js. They find it more fast and convenient to use. The older application was in JSPs. As a part of modernizing they are working on various front-end patterns like Navigatin pattern, Input pattern, data pattern, Scrolling, Modular, Thumbnail, Calendar object , Drop down pattern, Format pattern, Image gallery , Video gallery, Table pattern etc. One of the major challenges they are facing is with search holder pattern where they are mapping the search with google API. In this module the near by of agent office is displayed depending on the location entered by the user. 

The team is using technologies like HTML, CSS, SASS, Javascripts, Angular javascriptat, REST services, AJAX and JAVA for back end. They work in Scrum Agile method. The agile team is guided by scrum master for any issues they are facing. The have sprints lasting for 2 weeks. While working on target of sprint the team must also work backlogs if any. “At times it is a bit irritating when new inputs are added at the end phase but still it works like that in Scrum and ultimately the product turns out well” says chandra. Apart from this they create responsive web pages using media query and custom directives.The team receives input as wireframes and HTML UI design document.The application consists of 3 platform where the top layer is front-end with abouve mentiond technologies. The intermediate layer is in Java and some parts on RUBY where REST get/Post calls are made. The third layer is cloud  and Content management system in pure Java where it is connected to Database.'
