<b>How is team work carried out ?</b>

The team consists of around 45 persons with around 20 people sitting at offshore in India. The team in Stockholm as the following hierarchy: 
<ul>
<li>Head of Digital Team - Lovisa Ivarsson</li>
<li>Front-end Developer -  Chandrakanth</li>
<li>Project Manager – ShankarGanapathy</li>
</ul>    
The task is share with a task flow manager. Front end team carries out their tasks and rum their deployment internally. In some cases the back end team makes the integration with front end code and makes the deployment in the server.The team really enjoys working together by sharing their thought, helping each other incase there is any issue, appreciating each other works and giving comments. The team seems to go for a team out once is month which involves going for a bio or dinner together to ensure that team building is taking place. 

<b>How is a day to day work ?</b>

The team starts everyday with daily scrum meeting where the team discusses on tasks and isuses they foresee on that day’s work. They discuss issues regarding priority also and once the daily stand ups are over everyone starts with their tasks.
What are the tools you are using ?
The team is using Eclipse IDE for development as theywork in secure systems they are not open to choose their own IDE. But the seems to be happy about working in the any IDE as they are more focused on completing the tasks.	

<b>TASK RUNNER-GULP</b>

They use Gulp for running task which is a fast and intuitive streaming build tool built on Node.js. Gulp is streaming plugins. It is cross –platform, code driven and use node streams to read data and pipe date to write to disk. It has great advantage of no input headsup and is much faster that other tools available in market. The team decided to take up GULP because it is good in asynchronous code. 

<B>TESTING TOOLD</B>

Is is important for the team to write unit test cases since they prefer carrying out testing automatically which saves time and energy. So the developers also focuses on writing unit test cases for the part of code they have written. The javascript testing is carried out in tools like karma and Jasmine. 

<b>Issue Tracking</b>

They use JIRA for issue tacking. It Create milestones, set due dates, and distribute work across entire software team.

<b>What are the challenges you are facing now?</b>
One of the major issue every developer face is Cross browser issues. We develop for many browsers like Chrome, Opera, Firefox, Internet Explorer. When it comes to primitive browsers it is always tough to deal with. Apart from this issues like image resolution, PNG images not supported in some browsers lower version, accessibility, tool tip are others. When using jquery always they face challenge with compromising performance. Here they try to avoid it to as much as they could. 

<b>What is your tips for junior font-end developers?</b>
Always plan your projects to avoid last minute stress. Front-end development and everything related to it is just a skill and any skill, believe it or not is learnable. The bad and at the same time the beauty of front-end development is that it’s moving forward very fast. So always keep learning things new. Be curious to know. You’re stacked with a bug or can’t figure something out? You are not alone, everyone even the most experienced developers have the same issues on almost every project. When this happens, call it out!
